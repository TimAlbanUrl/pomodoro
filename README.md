## chase peek efficiency with this timer designed to help you stay focus as long as possible

* The pomodoro technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. You can also adjust the work and break period as you like.

* Setting up the tool
** navigate your way to the deployment page to pick any version or simply follow the link to the latest version: https://timalbanurl.github.io/pomodoro/

* Using the tool
** at the top of the page is a display of which phase is currently on (none by default). current phase is displayed in red text
** a clock and a timer tells you the time left for the current phase.
** the green 'start/reset' button starts the cycles using the work and pause time given by the user underneath it. clicking this button when the timer is running will reset the page.
** both time selection zones allow for picking minutes and seconds. in order to pick 1'30 for example, type in '1.5'.
